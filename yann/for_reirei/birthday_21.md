Dear Reirei,
Happy 21st birthday! I'm writing this a month and a half early because I'm scared I won't be good enough to do so on your actual birthday.

There's so much I want to tell you, and so little energy to do it. Where do I start? I'm so proud of you for having the courage to take a gap year. I'm so happy you've been able to spend time with your family at home. I can't wait to visit someday.
