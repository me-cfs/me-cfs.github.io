Dear Reirei,
Happy 21st birthday! 

I'm writing this a month and a half early because I'm scared I won't be good enough to do so on your actual birthday.

There's so much I want to tell you, and so little energy to do it. Where do I start? I'm so proud of you for having the courage to take a gap year. I'm so happy you've been able to spend time with your family at home. You had two crazy years, emotionally, physically, and mentally. And it's great you're taking a step back and doing things at your pace. I can't wait to visit you in Niigata someday. Try your favourite foods, visit the beach, meet your family, it sounds like a dream. 

You've been so supportive to me despite my limitations. I don't know how I could ever thank you. I'm forever grateful, and whatever I have the ability to do, I will do it for you. I just wish I was better so I could spoil you whenever you are sick, because you deserve it more than anything.
