[This part of my website is unrelated to ME/CFS and Long COVID. If you wish to go back to my ME/CFS stuff, [here's a link to the main page](https://me-cfs.github.io/)]

### Trustworthy Aggregators
* [Orientations politiques des journaux français et étrangers - Sciences Po](https://www.integrersciencespo.fr/orientations-politiques-de-la-presse-etrangere-et-francaise/comment-page-3)
* [Wikipedia Reliable Source Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources)

### Specific tools
* [US Based: Political donations of companies tracker](https://www.goodsuniteus.com)
* Search Wikipedia for info and ownership (remember, wikipedia can be edited by anyone, don't blindly trust)

### Problematic Aggregators
* [Allsides](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news) (pretty much useless because focuses on left-right ratings, not trustworthiness or integrity)
* [Ground News](https://ground.news/)
* [media bias fact check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/filtered-search/) (Left right ratings are terrible, but reliability ratings are okay)
