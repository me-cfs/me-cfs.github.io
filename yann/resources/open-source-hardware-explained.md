# Explaining Open Source Hardware

The simple summary is: What if we said “fuck copyright and patents”

Very long summary: 
Open-source hardware is like a set of instructions for building something, that anyone can use, change, and improve. 

I’ll use a lamp as an example. Imagine someone designs a lamp and shares the full instructions online, including how to put together the parts and where to get the materials. Now, anyone can follow those instructions to build their own lamp. Any number of people can build the lamp, and sell/trade/give it to others, meaning there is no monopoly of the product by anyone. If someone finds a better way to connect the wires or uses a cheaper material, they can update the instructions and share that with everyone. This means the lamp can keep improving, and anyone, anywhere, can benefit from the changes.

How it works is that instead of a company owning the lamp design and making people pay for it, the design is created by hobbyists and freely shared. If you want to make the lamp, you don’t have to buy an expensive company owned and patented. You can either assemble it yourself by buying the parts using the instructions or buy/recieve it from someone who did that, without paying a cent to a company. You can also tweak it or ask for help if something isn’t working right. It’s a way of working together and improving things without one company controlling everything.

This way of sharing designs challenges capitalism because, in a capitalist system, companies control products to make money. They keep their designs secret and only sell them for a profit. In contrast, open-source hardware doesn’t focus on making money—it focuses on making things better for everyone. You can make your own, or help others do it, and all the changes and improvements are shared freely.

This idea also connects to anarchism because it’s mutual aid and collaboration without being controlled by a hierarchical company or government. Everyone has an equal say in how the lamp is made and improved. For example, someone in one part of the world might find a way to make the lamp using local materials, while someone in another country might find a way to make it more energy-efficient. These ideas can be shared with the whole community, and no one has to ask permission from a corporation or worry about paying extra money. Everyone contributes what they can to make something useful, and the focus is on community and fairness rather than profit.

This also changes the way supply chains work. In a traditional system, companies control how products are made, where the materials come from, and who sells them. With open-source hardware, people can source their own materials locally, create things themselves, or work with others to build what’s needed. This means the supply chain isn’t controlled by a few big companies, but by the community working together to meet their needs.

For example, if you wanted to build a car, you could download the design for the car and use an open-source engine, open-source parts, and even open-source software. Each part of the supply chain—the engine design, the parts suppliers, the materials used—could all be open and available to everyone. People could share what they’ve learned about how to improve components or make the car more sustainable. Instead of relying on big car companies to dictate how a car is made, the entire supply chain could be collaborative, with communities working together to create what they need, from the engine to the body, all based on designs that anyone can use and improve. This turns the traditional supply chain model on its head, focusing on shared knowledge and resources instead of centralised control and profit.

This model already works really well for anything online, proving that collaboration, openness, and shared knowledge can create powerful and widely used products. An example is Linux which is a globally dominant operating system (nearly every website you visit or data you have stored online is stored using linux, and android is made using linux) all built on the collaboration of thousands of people around the world, no companies involved. Other examples are, web browsers like Firefox and tools like WordPress have been developed and improved by global communities, with everyone benefiting from constant updates and innovations. The key to their success is the idea that when software is made open, anyone can contribute, fix bugs, improve features, and adapt it for different needs. This model eliminates the need for a central authority or a company controlling the product, focusing instead on the collective effort of a community. These FOSS (free and open source software) projects not only work efficiently but often outperform company owned alternatives because they can be constantly refined and tailored by anyone with the skills to do so. The success of FOSS shows that when knowledge is made freely available, it can thrive through collaboration and shared expertise, paving the way for similar open-source models to expand into hardware.
