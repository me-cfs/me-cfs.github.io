This redditor has been disabled by ME/CFS (subtype of long covid) and is now living in poverty, unable to work, and lost everything that brings joy in life. ME/CFS and Long Covid are disabling millions for life. Yet there is no treatment or cure. Research funding is [the lowest](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568148/) of any disease compared to disease burden. Donate to the [Open Medicine Foundation](https://www.omf.ngo) to help those of us in need. To learn more about the situation you can:
