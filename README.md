## About
Hi I'm Yann and I have very severe ME/CFS from a covid infection. I'm bedridden, unable to speak, unable to sit, and unable to tolerate others in my presence. This site is a collection of anything I wanted to share or compile in relation to ME/CFS and Long Covid. I hope the content here is useful.

This image shows how I am 99% of the time. I have extensive sound and light proofing becaude my brain usually cannot process the stimuli of sound and light without using too much energy. I am lucky enough to (as of now) be able to occasionally use my phone. I have spent periods unable to interact with the world at all: only daydreaming, when my brain has enough energy to do so.
