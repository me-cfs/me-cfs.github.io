This redditor has been disabled by ME/CFS (subtype of long covid) and is now living in poverty, unable to work, and lost everything that brings joy in life. ME/CFS and Long Covid are disabling millions for life. Yet there is no treatment or cure. Research funding is [the lowest](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568148/) of any disease compared to disease burden. Donate to the [Open Medicine Foundation](https://www.omf.ngo) to help those of us in need. To learn more about the situation you can:
* Watch the academy nominated [Unrest](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XOpyLTyVxco) documentary
* Read [testimony](https://www.whitneydafoe.com/mecfs/whatismecfs/) from Whitney Dafoe who nearly died from the illness and is bedridden, unable to speak, and tubefed.
* Read the [wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgic_encephalomyelitis/chronic_fatigue_syndrome)
