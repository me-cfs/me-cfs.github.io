_This is an amateur website by a severely disabled person. So sorry if there is a lot of unfinished, outdated, or buggy things. Hopefully one day if I improve I'll be able to improve the website as well :)._

## About
Hi I'm Yann and I have very severe ME/CFS from a covid infection. I'm bedridden, unable to speak, unable to sit, and unable to tolerate others in my presence. This site is a collection of anything I wanted to share or compile in relation to ME/CFS and Long Covid. I hope the content here is useful. 

![Image](https://me-cfs.github.io/files/img/me_very_severe.jpeg)
This image shows how I am 99% of the time. I have extensive sound and light proofing becaude my brain usually cannot process the stimuli of sound and light without using too much energy. I am lucky enough to (as of 2024) be able to occasionally use my phone. I have spent periods unable to interact with the world at all: only daydreaming, when my brain has enough energy to do so. Before ME/CFS I was an avid skier and mountainbiker, studying and hoping to pursue an academic career in social data science, specifically voting behaviour and election interference.
