## Long Covid Action Project is dangerous, and is actively hurting the Long Covid community 

**TLDR:** Long Covid Action Project (LCAP) brands itself as an organisation fighting for long covid research. But the organisation is built upon misinformation and distortion of facts (whether intentionally or unintentionally). Its actions are more harmful to the long covid community than beneficial. 

The problem with them can be summarised as: “They take opinions on what the cause and cure of Long Covid is, before it has been proven by research, and claim them as fact. They try to push governments to only study what they believe causes and cures long covid while neglecting all the rest”.

**Summary of sections:**
* They claim long covid is like AIDS and solely caused by viral persistence. Which is a harmful way to present the disease and not backed by research.
* They disrupted the long covid moonshot and asked it to focus nearly only on viral persistence and no other issue related to long covid, which neglects the majority of patients.
* They claim that antivirals will be the cure (without scientific evidence) and try to make all research funding go to antivirals.
* They claim to be made up of scientists experts and researchers, but none of the people listed on the website are.
* They have harassed, doxxed, sent death threats, and misogynistic insults to members of the long covid community.

# “Viral persistence and nothing else”
Long covid action project claims that Long Covid is a disease with:
> “**AIDS**-like immune dysregulation which **researchers attribute to SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence**.”

(this is a quote taken straight from the [front page](https://longcovidactionproject.com)). This quote says many things that are untrue and/or unproven and claims them as fact:
* Immune dysregulation has been found in large subsets of long covid patients (but not all). This immune dysregulation is not even near to being similar to AIDS. AIDS causes a near destruction of the immune system, which before treatment was found, was a death sentence. 
* Viral persistence has been found upto a year in a subset of long covid patients. Saying all long covid patients have viral persistence is false. Saying that viral persistence is the cause of all long covid is misinformation as no research has proven this and much research points to other possible factors. It may however be a mechanism in some people. 
* Long covid is comprised of/can cause many different conditions: from POTS, MCAS, and dysautonomia to ME/CFS, IBS, and autoimmune diseases. (and much more.)

Classifying long covid as a single distinct disease caused exclusively by viral persistance is not only contrary to current research, but also neglects the large long covid population presenting diverse symptoms. 

# Long covid moonshot disruption 
But these people are sure of what they are doing. Therefore they have made a [campaign](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-bernie-sanders-to-enact-the-heal-legislation-proposal-for-long-covid ) to ask the Long covid moonshot bill to not put any effort into diseases which are a part of long covid such as Dysautonomia (which affects a large majority of LC patients [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9110879/)) and ME/CFS (which affects 50% of long covid patients [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9844405/) ). Claiming the focal point of the long covid bill should be viral persistence. In effect, instead of letting scientists study where there science points to, focalising efforts on viral persistence and ignoring the rest.

This campaign has gone around long covid communities and has received many signatures. It was however presented in a malicious manner. For example in this reddit community (before mods removed the post for disinformation) there was a post with 120 upvotes linking to the signature with the title as “Sign this letter requesting treatment!! Bernie is requesting billions for us” with no additional context. Which is not what the letter actually suggests. The actual letter is under the place where you sign so people will sign before reading the letter or won’t read the letter at all. They have managed to gather 8’000 signatures this way. 

This letter also suggests 28 billion dollars of funding for LC per year (which is ridiculous, given that that is half the NIH yearly budget.) It would mean long covid gets more funding than all cancers, all genetic diseases, and AIDS *put together*. Fundamentally, this is simply unserious and shows a shocking lack of pragmatism, which will hurt perceptions of the long covid community. At the HELP hearing on Long Covid, two LCAP activists shouted "Moonshot kills" in front of the Senators.

# “Antivirals are the cure”
Another problem is an inherent obsession with antivirals. No evidence points to the fact that antivirals are a cure/treatment for long covid. They should be studied but not focused on solely. There exists many more promising potential treatments such as ampligen, BC007 and drugs attacking oxidative stress. However in their proposed changes to senator Sander’s bill they want long covid research to be nearly solely focused on antivirals to cure and treat long covid. A “documentary” they made which is prominent on their front page is called “ANTIVIRALS NOW”. 

# Inconsistencies 
The project claims to be “developed by people with Long Covid who are journalists, professors, scientists and experts”. However only three names come up on their website. One of these people is a documentary filmmaker, another is an artist, and a third is of unknown profession, though no university pages or linkedin profiles show anyone with that name being a researcher or professor. 

# Harassment against fellow long haulers
There have been multiple accusations of harassment from LCAP allies. They demonise anyone who says that there may be a link between long covid and ME/CFS, while they themselves comparing Long Covid to AIDS. They claim that anyone that doesn’t see viral persistence as the only possible cause and mechanism of long covid, are malevolent people trying to steal from long covid patients (even though many of the people saying this are long covid patients). 

I spoke to a longhauler who has been a target of harassment from LCAP and their allies for views that they have published alongside many others in the long covid community. They agreed to let me quote them on the condition of anonymity due to recieving death threats from LCAP allies in the past. Here are some quotes: 
* “Key LCAP allies have doxxed mainstream activists, sent serious misogynistic abuse. After I published [redacted for anonymity], one of LCAP's most prominent allies (who spoke at their recent small protest and who doesn't actually have Long Covid himself) wrote 2 public death threats against us on twitter.”
* “Intellectually and scientifically, they're fundamentally unserious. Whereas there are a lot of people with scientific backgrounds in the mainstream advocacy community, hence organisations like patient-led research collaborative, LCAP is made up of people who are not only scientifically and academically ignorant, but are unaware of their own ignorance.”
* “They are convinced that viral persistence is the be all and end all, and anyone who disagrees is described as saying that Long Covid is "nothing new." Of course, the mainstream position is far more complex than Long Covid being "nothing new," the mainstream positions being something like; there is a large subset that overlaps with ME/CFS both in terms of symptoms and underlying mechanisms, though that doesn't discount the importance of viral persistence; viral persistence may well play a big role in Long Covid, but its importance may vary from subset to subset and it may just be one of many mechanisms.”
* “They're not a group that deserves to be taken seriously [their main achievement being] making Long Covid twitter incredibly toxic.”

Hoping my fellow longhaulers a wonderful day. Love Yann.

**Edit:** I was informed of an occurrence where LCAP was openly misleading. LCAP claimed they sent 500k letters to the government but what actually happened is they got 1’000 signatures. [Twitter thread showing this](https://twitter.com/inkblue01/status/1778609592273949005?s=46)

**Edit 2:** A small minority of completely new reddit accounts have shown exactly why it was necessary to write this post. I was insulted and called a [tw] >!retard!< in one comment. Which was thankfully removed by the mods for breaking rule three. Another new reddit user reported my account for being suicidal and I got a message from the reddit suicide hotline (minutes after I replied to an argument claiming I was silencing LCAP.) I am not sure how but the founder of LCAP found out my first name maybe I mentioned in past comments. To you LCAP people or allies, if you want to bully me you can but I will just add it to this post. Cheers.


**Edit 3:** This post somehow made it to LCAP. An hour ago there were 60 comments the large majority of which agreed with the post. An hour later there are 120 comments and most of the new comments are spammed copy paste by the LCAP founder.

**Edit 4:** This [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9839201/) (the most cited long covid paper) is a great review of long covid treatment 
and research. I recommend everyone give it a read.

# Reply from the founder of LCAP

This post is hateful & false. As the founder of LCAP, I wanted to clear up that Yann is intentionally spreading disinformation about LCAP & LCAP's HEAL legislation that will harm pwLC. In no way does HEAL or the research bill "limit" itself to viral persistence, please take a look at the research language in VITAL for more info.

Furthermore, LCAP has a strict no hate policy & will confront any attempts like this one to attack Long Covid activists.

“LCAP invites everyone to join with our non-partisan trans-founded organization, to call for solidarity & actions that are inclusive, diverse, & anti-oppressive in order to take down structural discrimination. LCAP affirms its continued solidarity for anti-racism, & is against discrimination & violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, & transgender (LGBTQQIP2SAA+) people who promote their self-affirmation, dignity & equality rights, increase their visibility as a social group, build community, & celebrate sexual diversity & gender variance. We do not tolerate attacks on race or gender. Through non-violent direct action we fight against all forms & expressions of colonial power that divide & destroy solidarity.

Be Loud 💥 Take Power 🔧 Fight Long Covid! 🔥”

# My Reply

Hi, Your HEAL campaign states as follows.

> Unless SARS-CoV-2 persistence is the focal point for new legislation it will perpetuate a profoundly challenging issue for both current and future people with Long Covid, as well as their families.

In my post I said:

> [LCAP] Claiming the focal point of the bill should be viral persistence.

Additionally it is great you have policies against harassment. It would be even better if they were enforced on your allies.

I am not sure why you brought up trans rights, anti-racism, and LGBTQ+ rights. Obviously I support these too, but the discussion here is about your organisation and biomedical research into long covid.

Kind Regards, Yann
