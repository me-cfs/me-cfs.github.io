An ever expanding list of things patients, advocates, allies or anyone else can do to help people with ME:
<br/>
## Doctors
### Teach your doctor
Teach your doctor about [ME/CFS](me-cfs.md). Send them [ME/CFS Resources for Clinicians](clinical-resources.md).
### Report Harmful Doctors
A lot of doctors do not know much about ME/CFS. That is not a reason to report them. However a small minority of doctors will prescribe harmful treatments (such as exercise), or give harmful advice and refuse to reconsider/learn when presented with evidence to the contrary. This is unacceptable and should be reported for the safety of all future ME/CFS patients.
### Correct Misdiagnoses
If you were misdiagnosed with something that should have been ME or Long Covid, inform the original doctor once you get a correct diagnosis. Otherwise the doctor will never know they made a mistake, and future patients will likely be misdiagnosed.

## Friends and Family
### Inform them
Explain to them [what ME/CFS is](me-cfs.md) and why it matters. 

## Fundraising
### Where to Donate
My recommendation on "cost-effective" charities:
* Research, [ME Research UK](https://www.meresearch.org.uk) (based in UK but funds research around the world)
* Advocacy, [MEAction](https://www.meaction.net)
* Both, your local/national ME organisation (make sure to vet them)
<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Other Popular Choices</summary>
* [Open Medicine Foundation](https://omf.ngo/)
  * While they are a solid choice, I think they aren't very good at sharing research results or publishing negative findings, in fact as of december 2024 they have an average 2 million donation per study published.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
  <summary>Charities to Avoid</summary>
* Long COVID Action Project (UK)
  * [See my blog post](https://me-cfs.github.io/lcap.html)
* ME Association (UK)
  * As of December 2024, their chair Neil Reiley has denied experiences of severe people and recommended harmful "treatments" ([See Petition](https://www.change.org/p/me-association-chair-neil-riley-must-step-down?recruited_by_id=25979f70-b27b-11ef-9380-55a94ca74c63&utm_source=share_petition&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&utm_medium=copylink))
</details>

If unsure about any organisation, please ask about them in a community with informed users, such as the [Science for ME Forum](https://s4me.info). [Some organisations](LCAP.md) are harmful or use their funds poorly.

## News
### Help Correct News Articles
It is rare for news sources to not make mistakes when reporting on ME. If you spot a mistake, contact the news service or journalist and kindly point out their errors. There is a chance they will listen and fix the article.
<details markdown="1">
  <summary>See Common Mistakes/Inaccuracies</summary>

* Does not mention Post-Exertional Malaise although that is the defining and most prominent symptom
* Uses the name "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" or even "Chronic Fatigue" when the official name is ME/CFS or ME.
* Fails to mention that it is a disabling illness, ie. referring to it as a "fatiguing condition" while listing "common symptoms" like "nausea" without mention that it leads people to be unable to work/bedbound/housebound etc.
* [This](https://www.meaction.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Journalists_-How-to-Report-on-ME_CFS.pdf) document from one of the largest ME/CFS organisations guides journalists through the do's and dont's of reporting on ME.

### Tell your story
Contact your local news source explaing your story and why it would make a good news bit.

### Write about ME/CFS
There are plenty of citizen journalism news websites that get a considerable about of traffic. Consider writing for them to advocate ME/LC.

## Online Knowledge
### Improve Wikipedia's References to ME/CFS
Although the ME/CFS page on wikipedia has improved a lot recently, there exist thousands of other pages referencing ME/CFS which have outdated or incorrect information. You can help by editing these. Alternatively, simply fixing spelling errors and formatting helps too!
### Improve and make MEpedia upto date
[Me-pedia](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/MEpedia:How_to_contribute) is a collaborative effort to host our knowledge of ME/CFS and related illnesses online in an accessible format. Think of it like the wikipedia of ME. Anyone can help, and there is always something to do!

## Petitions
### Long Term Petitions
* [Ask Cochrane to withdraw their Harmful 2019 Exercise therapy for "CFS" Review](https://www.change.org/p/cochrane-withdraw-the-harmful-2019-exercise-therapy-for-cfs-review)
