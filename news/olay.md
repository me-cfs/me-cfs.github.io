Keeping upto date with what is going on in the ME/CFS/LC world is not only interesting, but extremly useful so you hear about potential treatments, interesting research, advocacy events you can take part in and more. However, there exists so much misinformation, especially sources trying to sell psuedoscientific "treatments", giving harmful advice, and innapropriately psychologising this disease. In this page, I'll give you some resources to keep upto date.
