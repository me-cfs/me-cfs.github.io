# A misrepresented illness, More PEM, less Fatigue

## What is PEM?
PEM is a major disease process and mechanism in itself. It is what makes ME stand out as a different clinical entity. 

## The Problems with Diagnosis based on Fatigue
* non-specific symptoms
### "Convienient" Psychological Mixups
It’s far far more common for people to have ME and think they have depression than the other way around. According to large 2023 CDC survey >90% of ME cases are undiagnosed. 

Meanwhile over 60-80+% of people who have ME says they were misdiagnosed with depression/burnout/anxiety/FND

## Current Situation
The vast majority of funding ends up going into "fatigue" and not PEM. 

In my experience, I suffered from many symptoms after a viral infection but not fatigue. It took about 1 year and me becoming very severe for the fatigue to become noticeable.  
  
I fit the ICC months after the virus, but it took me much longer (and becoming bedridden) to fit the IOM and CCC. I really think the BPS folks and the name “chronic fatigue syndrome” have skewered views of the disease while self-selecting for patients with more fatigue.
