### Lack of Funding ->
Only 3% the research funding of comparable illnesses. 
### Lack of Research ->

### Lack of quality evidence -> 
Biomarkers, treatments etc. 

### Lack of institutional and official recognition -> 

## Exacerbating Factors
### Lack of Visibility 
* Institutional Neglect causes Suicides
* Many deaths and such in undiagnosed people not attributed to the disease. -> Statistics make disease look less bad then it is due to lack of visibility
* People affected can’t even get out their beds. We are “millions missing” no one sees our struggle. 
### Lack Funding
* Most are denied disability benefits due to lack of institutional recognition which makes funding research privately a hard endeavour 

## How can we break the loop?
* Strong political will?
