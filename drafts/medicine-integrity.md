# Medicine has lost it’s scientific integrity
[draft article]

Yes, please, people who aren’t to focused on the research or are new. Being written in a scientific journal does not mean something is true.

I can’t believe a portion of the people publishing studies on [#MECFS](https://x.com/hashtag/MECFS?src=hashtag_click) actively think it is the same thing as burnout. How uninformed must you be… And of course governments choose to fund them because their “research” fits the narrative that pwME are lazy. Utter Delusion.

## Low Quality
This is more of a “my person experience” rant then a high quality discussion as I don’t have the energy for the latter right now, but here goes:  
  
Why do a chunk of published studies in ME/LC feel absolutely worthless? Why is it almost easy to find errors in published papers in this discipline? Why do the descriptions of the illness in the literature tend to be littered with inaccuracies, sometimes even misspellings of the name and unfamiliarity with the diagnosis criteria? Why do the large majority of papers overstate their findings, and have abstracts containing unsupported claims? Why do many papers pretend to be in a sort of void (ie. tested a couple blood markers and found no difference with controls => conclusion: Long COVID is probably psychological, completely ignoring the mountain of research showing biological abnormalities)?  
  
Perhaps this is the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)speaking, but I feel like if I had the energy to do it, I could write more balanced and informative non-technical parts of a lot of these papers. And I have no specialisation in biology/medicine at all, all I have is this illness and I’ve spent a decent amount of time on this forum this past year.  
  
Is this a normal thing in medicine? Or is this specific to ME/LC? Or am I imagining things and being unfairly critical to researchers?  
  
I want to note this criticism does not apply to every researcher at all, and there are plenty who are doing a wonderful job. And even those I criticise have far far far more medical expertise than I have a chance of ever achieving during my lifetime.  
  
But a non-negligeable chunk of these papers written by professionals don’t feel professional at all. It often feels like the authors either haven’t bothered to read up much about LC/ME and their views are partly formed by stereotypes, ME = Fatigue etc. Or they are entrenched in some personal belief system about ME or LC and see everything through their pet theory ignoring the fact their theory hasn’t been proven yet.
