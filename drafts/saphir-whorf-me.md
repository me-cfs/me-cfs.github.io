# The Saphir-Whorf Hypothesis in ME: how words define our subjective experiences and perpetuate prejudice and misunderstanding
[draft article] 

## It’s all tiredness
NHS calling ME “chronic tiredness syndrome”. What’s next, persistent yawning delirium?

Media uses “chronic fatigue” without the syndrome

See blog post: [A misrepresented illness, more PEM less fatigue](https://me-cfs.github.io/drafts/misrepresented-fatigue-pem.html)

## Doublespeak
“Holistic” meaning “psychological” and “biopsychosocial” meaning “psychosocial” is the kind of linguistic tricks the people oppressing us have continually used to keep credibility.

"healing”, “medically-unexplained”, “rewire your brain”, “software not hardware” etc.

I think this was said in another thread, but it’s “shrödinger’s somatic symptom”. When it is used between professionals, it nearly always means psychogenic, but when a patient asks what it means, the doctor will say physical.

“BPS” when used by psychosomatisers is such an Orwellian twisting of words.

There’s nothing “bio” about their beliefs, it’s all psychosocial, but by having “bio” in the name, they claim to be the “moderate” middle ground while the “extremist” “activists” claim the illness is entirely biological.

## Symptoms as subjective complaints
Reminds me of Nath that keeps on saying pwME are “complaining” about X, Y, Z instead of a more obvious “suffering from” or “experiencing”.

“bothersome” “complaints”

PEM is not a “subjective” worsening of symptoms. PEM is an objective worsening of the entire illness, including symptoms, and functional baseline (capacity for triggering more PEM.) Sometimes it does not go away and leads to a permanent worsening of the condition.

We need this paradigm shift in the literature. Without it PEM is dismissed as subjective “complaints” about symptoms post-exertion. This has been done for decades to support exercise therapy, and is now (in 2024!) being pushed by the NIH with “effort preference”.

i found something i wrote a couple months ago which touches on the ignoring of pem you and i were talinf about:

I feel like the discourse, the research, and pretty much everything and anything around Long COVID and ME focuses on the “symptoms” and not the functional disability.

I am not disabled by symptoms alone; I am disabled by a profound functional limitation driven by post-exertional malaise (PEM). The primary barrier isn’t the severity of individual symptoms but the inability to exert beyond a narrow threshold without severe consequences.

A lot of discourse and people talking about the disease focus on symptoms, and their severity, while nearly ignoring an aspect of functional disability. Even studies trying to characterise the disease or outcome measures for trials sometimes seem to forget the “disability” part and focus on the patient’s symptoms, which doctors often frame as “complaints”. It seems to be a form of medical reductionism, which means in a lot of the case the essence of our experiences as patients are missed out on. A doctor might see us and think “tired, belly hurts, can’t sleep, don’t like sports”…

We are then viewed by professionals and researchers as a collection of ‘complaints’ rather than the profound disability we experience. This framing makes it easier to psychologise or dismiss our condition.

I was emailing a researcher recently and asked them what they think the odds are we find a cure within the next 20 years. They said that isn’t extremely likely but a treatment that alleviates most symptoms by around 50% is definitely a possibility. But to me, someone who can’t talk, is bedridden, 50% more or less symptoms is obviously a change, but it doesn’t fundamentally change much, at the end of the day, I’m still stuck in my bed isolated from the world. A treatment that can improve functional capacity by 50%, even if my symptoms stay the same, now that would be a profound lifechanger.

Why are we focused on the symptoms, and not the disability? (and the phenomenon of PEM, which seems to be the driving factor behind the disability)…

I’ve been thinking about this more, and perhaps this is pushed by pharmaceuticals.

It’s much more profitable to have to “treat” every single symptom a chronic illness patient has with drugs, than to find a single drug which gets down to the root cause and treats the illness.

Symptomatic treatment is like best case scenario for pharmaceutical profits. You have drugs that don’t fix the illness (so lifetime customers) and your drugs are generic and treat only symptoms, you you have a large and diverse market.

## Patients as Activists
Painting Patients as untrustworthy, therefore our agency to define our experiences is removed.

“militant” hostile defensiveness "activists"

## Focusing on "positivity"
People and the media love focusing on "positive" stories and recovery stories because they are feel good.
Also people who are able to share their experiences have most likely recovered.
They are systemically biased towards positivity.

When our real experiences and struggles are negated under the guise of "positivity" it becomes a problem.

## Conforming to Concepts healthy People can Understand

> 'Boom and bust’ is another example. Very few patients would describe the activity that caused their PEM as a ‘boom’. It can imply they are behaving irresponsibly. They may have simply laughed for a few minutes or sat up and cleaned their teeth.
