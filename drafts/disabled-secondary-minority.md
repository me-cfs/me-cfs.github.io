# Disabied people are a secondary minority group, forgotten and ignored

Even if you look in academia.

There are (deservedly) many of programs and specialists in African-American Studies, Women’s/Gender Studies, Native American Studies etc.

But disability studies, in comparison, is a tiny field with little funding or expertise. There’s even a lack of intersectional awareness. 

There is no legitimate disabiloty news service, unlike other minorities which have things like LGBTQNation and Pink News

A complete erasure: The case of switzerland
in switzerland disabled people are completely erased so I was never exposed to disability
they go to special schools so we never met disabled people as kids, public transport isnt accessible nor is basically any shop or service so we basically never see disabled people, were completely erased

PLUS euthanasia is legal here and disability benefits are way under poverty wage
