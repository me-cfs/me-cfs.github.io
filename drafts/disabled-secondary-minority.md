# Disabied people are a secondary minority group, forgotten and ignored

Even if you look in academia.

There are (deservedly) many of programs and specialists in African-American Studies, Women’s/Gender Studies, Native American Studies etc.

But disability studies, in comparison, is a tiny field with little funding or expertise. There’s even a lack of intersectional awareness. 

There is no legitimate disabiloty news service, unlike other minorities which have things like LGBTQNation and Pink News
