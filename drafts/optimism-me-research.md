# Reasons to be Optimistic about ME Research

There are a million reasons to be pessimistic about ME research. So to counter them, here are are a few reasons to be optimistic:

## ML might crack the complexity
So many conditions from Rheumatoid Arthritis, to MS, to Lupus, to ME don’t have a single marker able to distinguish the disease. 

The most likely advancement in technology that will help diagnose these are ML algorithms finding patterns in biomedical data too complex for humans to find.

This is far likelier than stumbling across a perfect biomarker (if that even exists) since these conditions are so biological complex. 

To get the data, we would need a massive study in the style of Wallit’s NIH study, but without the psychosomatic assumptions and with thousands of participants.
