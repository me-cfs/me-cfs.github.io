## News
### Help Correct News Articles
It is rare for news sources to not make mistakes when reporting on ME. If you spot a mistake, contact the news service or journalist and kindly point out their errors. Their is a decent chance they will listen and fix the article.

**Common Mistakes/Innacuracies:**
* Does not mention Post-Exertional Malaise although that is the defining and most prominent symptom.
* Uses the name "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" or even "Chronic Fatigue" when the official name is ME/CFS or ME.
* Fails to mention that it is a disabling illness, ie. referring to it as a "fatiguing condition" while listing "common symptoms" like "nausea" without mention that it leads people to be unable to work/bedbound/housebound etc.
## Research
### Participate in Research
* Sign up to the OMF's [Study ME](https://www.omf.ngo/studyme/) registry so you are notified when the OMF needs participants for ME studies in your area.
