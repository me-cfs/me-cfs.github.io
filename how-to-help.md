An ever expanding list of things patients, advocates, allies or anyone else can do to help people with ME:
<br/>
## Doctors
### Report Harmful Doctors
A lot of doctors do not know much about ME/CFS. That is not a reason to report them. However a small minority of doctors will prescribe harmful treatments (such as exercise), or give harmful advice and refuse to reconsider/learn when presented with evidence to the contrary. This is unacceptable and should be reported for the safety of all future ME/CFS patients.

## Fundraising
### Where to Donate
There are plenty of different projects, organisations, and labrotories who ask for money in the ME/CFS community. Personally, to optimise your "bang for your buck", I would recommend the [Open Medicine Foundation](https://www.omf.ngo) for biomedical research, and [MEAction](https://www.meaction.net) for advocacy. Your local/national ME organisation could be a good call too, as they usually fund both research and advocacy (make sure to vet them properly though). If unsure about any organisation, project, or lab, I recommend asking about them in a community with informed users, such as the [Science for ME Forum](https://s4me.info). [Some organisations](LCAP.md) are harmful or use their funds poorly.
### Fundraising Ideas
* Birthday Fundraiser

## News
### Help Correct News Articles
It is rare for news sources to not make mistakes when reporting on ME. If you spot a mistake, contact the news service or journalist and kindly point out their errors. Their is a decent chance they will listen and fix the article.

  <summary>See Common Mistakes/Inaccuracies</summary>

* Does not mention Post-Exertional Malaise although that is the defining and most prominent symptom
* Uses the name "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" or even "Chronic Fatigue" when the official name is ME/CFS or ME.
* Fails to mention that it is a disabling illness, ie. referring to it as a "fatiguing condition" while listing "common symptoms" like "nausea" without mention that it leads people to be unable to work/bedbound/housebound etc.

## Online Knowledge
### Improve Wikipedia's References to ME/CFS
### Improve and make MEpedia upto date
[Me-pedia](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/MEpedia:How_to_contribute) is a collaborative effort to host our knowledge of ME/CFS and related illnesses online in an accessible format. Think of it like the wikipedia of ME. Anyone can help, and there is always something to do!

## Research
### Participate in Research
* Sign up to the OMF's [Study ME](https://www.omf.ngo/studyme/) registry so you are notified when the OMF needs participants for ME studies in your area.
