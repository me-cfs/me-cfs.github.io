An ever expanding list of things patients, advocates, allies or anyone else can do to help people with ME:
<br/>
## Doctors
### Teach your doctor
Teach your doctor about [ME/CFS](me-cfs.md). Send them resources like [MEAction's primer for clinicians](https://www.meaction.net/learn/healthcare-providers/) or the [Mayo Clinic Proceedings](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00402-0/fulltext). ([in Deutsch](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00508-024-02372-y))
### Report Harmful Doctors
A lot of doctors do not know much about ME/CFS. That is not a reason to report them. However a small minority of doctors will prescribe harmful treatments (such as exercise), or give harmful advice and refuse to reconsider/learn when presented with evidence to the contrary. This is unacceptable and should be reported for the safety of all future ME/CFS patients.

## Friends and Family
### Inform them
Explain to them [what ME/CFS is](me-cfs.md) and why it matters. 

## Fundraising
### Where to Donate
To optimise your "bang for your buck", I would recommend the [Open Medicine Foundation](https://www.omf.ngo) for biomedical research, and [MEAction](https://www.meaction.net) for advocacy. Your local/national ME organisation could be a good call too, as they usually fund both research and advocacy (make sure to vet them properly though). If unsure about any organisation, project, or lab, I recommend asking about them in a community with informed users, such as the [Science for ME Forum](https://s4me.info). [Some organisations](LCAP.md) are harmful or use their funds poorly.

## News
### Help Correct News Articles
It is rare for news sources to not make mistakes when reporting on ME. If you spot a mistake, contact the news service or journalist and kindly point out their errors. There is a chance they will listen and fix the article.
<details markdown="1">
  <summary>See Common Mistakes/Inaccuracies</summary>

* Does not mention Post-Exertional Malaise although that is the defining and most prominent symptom
* Uses the name "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" or even "Chronic Fatigue" when the official name is ME/CFS or ME.
* Fails to mention that it is a disabling illness, ie. referring to it as a "fatiguing condition" while listing "common symptoms" like "nausea" without mention that it leads people to be unable to work/bedbound/housebound etc.

</details>

### Tell your story
Contact your local news source explaing your story and why it would make a good news bit.

## Online Knowledge
### Improve Wikipedia's References to ME/CFS
### Improve and make MEpedia upto date
[Me-pedia](https://me-pedia.org/wiki/MEpedia:How_to_contribute) is a collaborative effort to host our knowledge of ME/CFS and related illnesses online in an accessible format. Think of it like the wikipedia of ME. Anyone can help, and there is always something to do!

## Petitions

* [Ask Cochrane to withdraw their Harmful 2019 Exercise therapy for "CFS" Review](https://www.change.org/p/cochrane-withdraw-the-harmful-2019-exercise-therapy-for-cfs-review)
